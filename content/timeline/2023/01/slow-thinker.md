For years I struggled in school and even regular conversations. Forming a proper response takes time and I disregard sharing what comes to my mind instantly.

In most cases, it hasn't been an issue to step back and give things some thought. Hitting the brakes on a crossroad until having a proper overview of the situation, however, does not work (at least I wouldn't recommend). Hence, it can become a hinderance in situations where quick reactions are necessary.
