We are ever so keen to elevate our lives to an extent that most likely will never be reached. This might be motivating for some – others may end up devastated. The latter commonly exists as the result of adopting external expectations and ideas on a purposeful life.

As Anton rightly says, life is unpredictable. Consequently, the biggest task in one’s life is perhaps balancing spontaneity and a sensible prospective.

> “By embracing the journey and striving towards our own personal ideals of perfection, we can find a sense of purpose and fulfillment in our lives, even in the midst of the chaos and uncertainty of the universe.”
