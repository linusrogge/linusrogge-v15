Despite the amount of times a person tells you they love you or they’ll be there for you – if these words don't match their actions, their behavior is closer to manipulation than anything else. 

As we tend to believe in the best in every person, especially those we feel something for, it might be hard to accept that these people take more than we can offer in the long term. 

I like to see “love” mainly as a verb. The constant commitment to another individual and their needs, nurturing both lives equally to protect solitude, sanity, and provide a space for growth.
