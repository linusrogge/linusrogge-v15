I don’t believe in the idea of dating apps. Frankly, I think it has created an irritable sense of what love and finding it .

Rarely do we make more of an effort to really get to know a person. We are on the lookout for redflags and, when we reach our threshold, we move on to the next person – without perhaps understanding why a person has certain characteristics, where their anxieties come from. What lies buried deep inside under old debris hardly sees the light of day because few do the work to dig for it.
