> “People are so surprised when you are kind to them, when you take time out of your life to help them out. Because the expectation is that everyone’s busy and no one has time to help anyone.
> But I guess that’s a product of the time we live in. We’re all so hyper-focused on ourselves that we forget we’re sharing the world with others.” *Manu Moreale*
