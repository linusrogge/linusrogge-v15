Analog photographs never cease to astonish me. Encapsulating the uniqueness of a moment forever without endless lakes requires a lot of luck, speed, and – at the same time – patience. To be in the moment and notice its details to decide what to capture.

There is no preview or deletion. It feels much more like art: thoughts go into each piece, one has to think about exposure and composition without another try – like paint on a canvas. Something that digital photography cannot replace.
