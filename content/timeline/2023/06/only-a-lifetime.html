    How do you know<br>
    If you've done everything right?<br>
    Is it the love you have at hand<br>
    Or the cash you kiss at night?
</p>
<p>
    How do you know<br>
    If it was worth it in the end?<br>
    Did every second really count<br>
    Or were there some you shouldn't spend<br>
    On anything but anyone you love?<br>
    Was this the life that you were dreaming of?<br>
    A movie night, a yellow light<br>
    You're slowing down and days are adding up
</p>
<p>
    So don't waste the time you have waiting for time to pass<br>
    It's only a lifetime<br>
    That's only a while<br>
    It's not worth the anger you felt as a child<br>
    Don't waste the time you have waiting for time to pass<br>
    It's only a lifetime<br>
    That's not long enough<br>
    You're not gonna like it without any love<br>
    So don't waste it
</p>
<p>
    I'm unimpressed<br>
    By the people preaching pain<br>
    For the sake of some small gain<br>
    In the sake of someone's name
</p>
<p>
    I'm unprepared<br>
    For my loved ones to be gone<br>
    Call 'em way too often now<br>
    Worry way too much about mom<br>
    Don't waste the time you have waiting for time to pass
</p>
<p>
    It's only a lifetime<br>
    That's only a while<br>
    It's not worth the anger you felt as a child<br>
    Don't waste the time you have waiting for time to pass<br>
    It's only a lifetime<br>
    That's not long enough<br>
    You're not gonna like it without any love<br>
    So don't waste it
</p>
<p>
    It's family and friends, and that's the truth<br>
    The fountain doesn't give you back your youth<br>
    It's staying up too late at night and laughing under kitchen lights<br>
    So hard you start to cry
</p>
<p>
    Don't waste the time you have waiting for time to pass<br>
    It's only a lifetime<br>
    That's not long enough<br>
    You're not gonna like it without any love<br>
    So don't waste it
</p>
