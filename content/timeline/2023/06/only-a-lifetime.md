How do you know
If you've done everything right?
Is it the love you have at hand
Or the cash you kiss at night?

How do you know
If it was worth it in the end?
Did every second really count
Or were there some you shouldn't spend
On anything but anyone you love?
Was this the life that you were dreaming of?
A movie night, a yellow light
You're slowing down and days are adding up

So don't waste the time you have waiting for time to pass
It's only a lifetime
That's only a while
It's not worth the anger you felt as a child
Don't waste the time you have waiting for time to pass
It's only a lifetime
That's not long enough
You're not gonna like it without any love
So don't waste it

I'm unimpressed
By the people preaching pain
For the sake of some small gain
In the sake of someone's name

I'm unprepared
For my loved ones to be gone
Call 'em way too often now
Worry way too much about mom
Don't waste the time you have waiting for time to pass

It's only a lifetime
That's only a while
It's not worth the anger you felt as a child
Don't waste the time you have waiting for time to pass
It's only a lifetime
That's not long enough
You're not gonna like it without any love
So don't waste it

It's family and friends, and that's the truth
The fountain doesn't give you back your youth
It's staying up too late at night and laughing under kitchen lights
So hard you start to cry

Don't waste the time you have waiting for time to pass
It's only a lifetime
That's not long enough
You're not gonna like it without any love
So don't waste it
