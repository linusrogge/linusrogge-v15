>> “They say when two people are angry at each other – you know why they shout? It’s a bit strange, because they're right next to each other […]. One ancient Sufi saint, he said the reason why people shout when they're angry, because although they’re next to each other physically, their hearts have become so far apart. And because they are so far apart, they feel they need to shout to try and make up that distance that has been created.

>> And have you noticed? It works the other way as well. When you have a very loving relationship and your heart is very close to someone, sometimes you can be with them in the room and you don't even have to say a word – and just the movement of the face and they understand you and you understand them￼￼.”
