> Still, I believe that when chasing success for the long term, well-designed products should be able to rely on A-grade fundamentals. Would you build a cathedral on quicksand? *Casper Lourens*

My e-mail client of choice is [Tempo](https://yourtempo.co). Before sunsetting, there was even a mobile app that I still miss dearly. 

[Casper](https://casper-lourens.com) – one of their designers – shared some insights about the process. On his note about Tempo’s icon set “Quill”, he wrote this paragraph I highly agree with. If the base of a product is well-formed, it will benefit everyone working on it at any point.
