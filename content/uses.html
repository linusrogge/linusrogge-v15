        <p>
            Please look at this page rather from an informative perspective. I am regularly questioning whether having a uses page is a good decision, because the urge to compare is strong.

            To that I have to say that I also started with a very basic setup that literally just worked at that time. When my needs grew and I needed more performance, I was fortunate enough to adjust the tools.

    <p>
        My setup consists of a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/" target="_blank">14" MacBook Pro (2021)</a> for personal use and a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/" target="_blank">16" MacBook Pro (2022)</a> for work. As a display at home, I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.de/LG-32UL500-W-Monitor-Radeon-FreeSync/dp/B07QDNHRG4" target="_blank">27" LG 32UL750-W</a> in combination with an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english" target="_blank">Apple Magic Keyboard</a> and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ2R2LL/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver" target="_blank">Apple Magic Trackpad</a>. At the Studio, I work with a <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/" target="_blank">Pro Display XDR</a>.

        My daily driver is an iPhone 11 Pro Max. However, I casually put some money aside here and there to upgrade to an iPhone 14 Pro at some point. Dynamic Island just had me sold.
    </p>
    <p>
        For recordings I use a <a href="https://www.beyerdynamic.de/fox.html" target="_blank">FOX Microphone</a> and my music plays on a <a href="https://www.apple.com/homepod-mini/" target="_blank">HomePod Mini</a> or <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/speakers/portable_speakers/soundlink-revolve-ii.html#v=soundlink_revolve_ii_black" target="_blank">BOSE SoundLink speaker</a>. On the go I worship ANC on my <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/" target="_blank">AirPods</a>.

    <p>
        I create interfaces in <a href="https://figma.com/">Figma</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I am also able to work with almost every app of the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html" target="_blank">Adobe Creative Cloud</a>. These include Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere Pro and After Effects.

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>
        All coding happens in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> and the default macOS terminal. I am working with Git using <a href="https://desktop.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a>. <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/" target="_blank">Transmit</a> is great for accessing (S)FTP servers.

    <p>
        For browsing, I switch between <a href="https://arc.net/" target="_blank">Arc</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">Safari</a>. My inbox is kept zero with <a href="https://yourtempo.co" target="_blank">Tempo</a> and Gmail with <a href="https://simpl.fyi" target="_blank">Simplify</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I recently switched from <a href="https://tweek.so" target="_blank">Tweek</a> to <a href="https://craft.do">Craft</a> for task planning, combining them with my notes. <a href="https://cron.com" target="_blank">Cron</a> is the best app for calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a replacement for spotlight search, <a href="https://raycast.com" target="_blank">Raycast</a> is a huge productivity boost. Tools like <a href="https://linear.app" target="_blank">Linear</a>, <a href="https://timingapp.com" target="_blank">Timing</a>, or <a href="https://dropoverapp.com" target="_blank">Dropover</a> come in handy for many of my other daily tasks.
