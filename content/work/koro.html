        During the pandemic, Piran asked me to support their team with some adjustments to the design of their online store. We focused especially on the selection of variants and types of products, as well as the pricing graph that transparently displays the tweaks made when a price faced some changes.

        Later into the process, I also took care of implementing the change into the Shopware theme. <a href="https://www.8mylez.com/">8MYLEZ</a> was an inalienable helping hand and provided great sources for tutorials.
