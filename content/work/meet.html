        Planning gatherings always felt like a burden to <a href="https://schaefkn.com" target="_blank">Kevin</a>, so he envisioned a better way to invite friends over. Reducing pain points with simple user-flows enables an effortless process to do so.

    <p>
        Whenever there is an upcoming event, you can create a Meet and send a link to everyone you'd like to invite. They can accept or decline it, see the shopping list, and – once the event is over – upload photos to keep memories.

        Meet was created to make people's lives easier by providing a simple service to plan and manage sleep&shy;overs, dates and family events. The design is just like that: <b>Simple and easy to understand</b>.

            Ultimately, the goal is to reduce time spent on the phone, and increase real life connection.

        The color <b>pink</b> is often associated with passion, love, warmth, as well as care, safety, understanding and hope – which is exactly what meeting your friends should feel like.
