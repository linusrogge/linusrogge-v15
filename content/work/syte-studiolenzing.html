    <p>
        The real estate industry is one of the industries in which a lot of tedious manual work still occurs. Project developers, investors, agents, architects and city planners sweat over enormous amounts of documents.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current process of real estate development is characterized by time-consuming data research like searching property records for ownership documents and purchase prices, phoning authorities, and on-site visits to gather data by eye.
    </p>
    <p>
        Syte felt it was time to bring the power of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to the architecture industry. We helped Syte create a tool in which urban planning, project development, and potential analysis are designed sustainably, smartly, and beautifully.

            In addition to the team's great work, I stiched together a brand guide to help internal processes when creating visuals and working with the brand's identity.

        <p>
            We were keen to create a wordmark that expresses Syte’s brand environment of architecture and the precision of AI in its typographic style. Like a solid construction, we have provided this base with industry-typical optical features: angularity, brutalism and the familiar map look.
