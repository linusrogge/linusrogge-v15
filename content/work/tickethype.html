        Ticket platforms are a dime a dozen. Unfortunately, hardly anyone manages to make ticket sales easy and pleasant for both event organizers and end customers. Most competing products are overloaded with features and charge high fees and commissions.

        The top priority from the start was to easen the workflow for both the promoter and the customer in terms of event creation, checkout and the overall experience.

        It takes less than three minutes to create an organizer account, an event and the corresponding tickets. Afterwards you will receive a link to a lucid sales page, where visitors can buy their tickets stress-free. The visitors receive their tickets automatically with the option to share them with participants or add them to Apple Wallet.

        <a href="https://vause.de/" target="_blank">Joel</a>, who came up with the idea, happens to be also a good friend of mine and I personally enjoy working on projects with people close to me. In a row of late nights we refreshed the complete look and feel of the platform, creating an impressive product that seeks to improve organisation of events and the market for tickets.

    <h2>Sellpage</h2>
    <p>
        Organizers are able to customize their selling pages to fit accordingly to the offered event. The heart of each page is the hero with an image, followed by more information about the event itself. The tickets can be found further below.

    <h2>Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
        A reduced dashboard enables what a proper dashboard actually does: providing a glance at sorted and optimized statistics and quick access to every important area.

    <h2>Visual language</h2>
    <p>
        Previously called "simpleticket", tickethype conveys an inviting, robust and familiar appearance. A bold choice in color stays in mind and beautifully accompanies visual elements and components.
